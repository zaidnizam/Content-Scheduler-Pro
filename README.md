## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from just scheduling posts?

WordPress's built-in scheduling only controls when content is published - not when it disappears. Content Scheduler Pro allows you to set both a start AND end date/time, plus you can place the scheduled content anywhere on your site using a shortcode.

### Can I use this for time-sensitive announcements?

Absolutely! This is perfect for sales announcements, special offers, holiday messages, or any content that should only appear for a specific time period.

### Does this work with any theme?

Yes! Content Scheduler Pro works with any properly coded WordPress theme.

### Does this slow down my site?

No, the plugin is lightweight and optimized for performance.

### Can I style the scheduled content?

Yes! You can style your content using the WordPress block editor just like any other content. Additionally, the plugin adds CSS classes to the output that you can target with custom CSS.

### Is it compatible with page builders?

Yes, you can place the shortcode in any page builder that supports shortcodes.

### What happens when the end date passes?

The content simply disappears from view - no redirects or 404 errors. The shortcode remains in place but displays nothing.

### Can I schedule multiple pieces of content?

Yes! You can create as many scheduled content blocks as you need.

### Does it work with caching plugins?

The plugin is compatible with most caching plugins, but for best results, you may need to adjust your cache settings to ensure time-sensitive content updates correctly.
